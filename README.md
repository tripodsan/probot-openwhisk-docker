# Custom Docker Images for OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk comes with a one megabyte limit for function ZIP files. This can be a too harsh limit for many practical purposes. In addition, the Node 6 action comes with a long list of pre-packaged depdendencies, including some of the most popular NPM packages. The newer Node 8 action does not include any pre-packaged dependencies, which means we are forced to trade-off between using a modern Node version or having access to useful packages.

Fortunately, OpenWhisk also supports the creation of custom Docker images, so we can circumvent this trade-off by creating a Docker image that has exactly the dependencies pre-installed that we need, without any of the stuff we don't need.

## Building it

Make sure you have Docker installed and are logged in to Docker Hub. The image is published under the `trieloff` namespace.

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

## Testing it

Once the function has been deployed, it can be tested using `npm test`

## What's included

The package is based on the dependency list of the original Node 6 image, whith a number of modifications:

* updated dependencies to the newest version
* removed deprecated and useless dependencies
* added dependencies that are specific to Project Helix
